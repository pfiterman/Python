#  Some people like to write pseudocode, English-like syntax that resembles code, to explain the problem in a series of steps
# let T = 0
# for each ticket on rail
#     Set T = T + 1
  
# Return T

# One aspect of writing an algorithm is how efficient it is. This is referred to as optimizing the code. 

# let T = 0

# for each pair of ticket on rail
#     Set T = T + 2

# Return T 

#  When writing an algorithm, it can be solved in many different ways and each can have its own pros and cons. 

# Recursion
# Recursion refers to a method or a function that will call itself. 
# It is used to resolve problems by breaking the problem down into sub-problems. 
# Let us take a look at some of the most popular types of recursive algorithms.

# Divide and conquer
# This consists of two parts. The first is breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems and the second is solving the final solution.

# Dynamic programming
# This is mainly used for optimization problems. It is similar to the divide and conquer algorithm in that it splits the problems into sub-problems  
# Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique used mainly for optimization problems. 
# It works by breaking a problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing the results for reuse. 
# This avoids repeated calculations and makes the solution more efficient. 
# Two key properties that make dynamic programming applicable are overlapping subproblems (the same smaller problems are solved multiple times) and optimal substructure (the optimal solution of the main problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems). 
# Common examples include the Fibonacci sequence, shortest path algorithms (like Bellman-Ford), and the Knapsack problem.

# Greedy algorithm
# This one finds the best solution in each and every step instead of approaching optimization in a global way.
# A greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the option that looks best at the current step. 
# It makes locally optimal choices in the hope that they lead to a globally optimal solution. 
# Greedy algorithms are simple and efficient, but they only work correctly when the problem has the greedy-choice property (a global optimum can be reached by choosing local optima) and optimal substructure. 
# Examples include activity selection, Huffman coding, Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms for minimum spanning trees, and Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths.
