# Multiple Inheritance
# Let’s say there are two classes, namely class A and class B. If you have to perform simple inheritance, it can be done as follows:

class A:
    pass
class B(A):
    pass

# If class A is the parent class and class B is inheriting from it, then class A is passed inside class B as a parameter. 
# This will allow class B to directly access the attributes and methods inside class A.

# Python also gives us the ability to perform multiple inheritance between classes.

class A:
   a = 1
   
class B:
   b = 2
   
class C(A, B):
   pass

c = C()
print(c.a, c.b)

# First, two classes called A and B are created and then variables a and b respectively are initialized with values. 
# A new class C is then defined and classes A and B are passed to it. This is how multiple inheritance is done in Python. 
# The order of classes is important, but not in this specific example. I then instantiate an object ‘c’ of class C. 
# The values of the a and b variables are printed over the object c of class C even though a and b are not present inside class C.
# The code above is an example of multiple inheritance.

# There are also other types of inheritance that fall under the umbrella of multiple inheritance. Let's examine an example.

# Multi-level inheritance
class A:
   a = 1

class B(A):
   a = 2

class C(B):
   pass

c = C()
print(c.a)

# The output is 2 because C derives from the immediate super class of C, and that's B. 
# Even though class A is the top-level base class, class C does not directly inherit from A 
# but instead inherits the attribute a from B and B has the attribute value of its member a = 2.

# The example above demonstrates multi-level inheritance where the derived class C inherits from class B. 
# The class B is in turn a derived class of base class A. Class B here is an intermediate derived class. 
# There are three levels of inheritance in this case, but it could be extended to many levels, though it may become impractical after a while.

# Built-in functions

# There are two built-in functions that can come in handy when trying to find the relationship between different classes and objects: 
# issubclass() and isinstance().

issubclass(A, B)

# Two classes are passed as arguments to this function and a Boolean result is returned. The above example can be extended as follows. 
print(issubclass(A,B))
print(issubclass(B,A))

# This illustrates how the child class is passed as the first argument. To avoid confusion, this can be read as: “Is B subclass of A?“ 
# You can see the result is "True" in the second case where child B is the subclass.

# Another built-in function similar to this one is isinstance() that determines if some object is an instance of some class. So if I write:
class A:
	pass
class B(A):
	pass

b = B()
print(isinstance(b,B)) # True
print(isinstance(b,A)) # True

# Now that you know how classes can be extended from other classes, let's look at another useful built-in function called the super() function.

# The super() function is a built-in function that can be called inside the derived class and gives access to the methods and variables of the parent classes 
# or sibling classes. Sibling classes are the classes that share the same parent class. When you call the super() function, 
# you get an object that represents the parent class in return.

# The super() function plays an important role in multiple inheritance and helps drive the flow of the code execution. 
# It helps in managing or determining the control of from where I can draw the values of my desired functions and variables.

# If you change anything inside the parent class, there is a direct retrieval of changes inside the derived class. 
# This is mainly used in places where you need to initialize the functionalities present inside the parent class in the child class as well. 
# You can then add additional code in the child class.

class Fruit():
    def __init__(self, fruit):
        print('Fruit type: ', fruit)


class FruitFlavour(Fruit):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('Apple')
        print('Apple is sweet')

apple = FruitFlavour() # Fruit type:  Apple  \n Apple is sweet

# In the code above, if I had commented out the line for super() function, the output is: 
# Apple is sweet

# This happened because when you initialize the child class, you don’t initialize the base class with it. 
# super() function helps you to achieve this and add the initialization of base class with the derived class.
