# Comprehensions
# comprehensions in python are a way to create a new sequence from an already existing sequence

# There are four main types of comprehensions in Python: 
# 1. List comprehension 
# 2. Dictionary comprehension 
# 3. Set comprehension 
# 4. Generator comprehension

# 1. List comprehension
# syntax: [ <expression> for x in <sequence> if <condition>] 

data = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31]

# Ex1: List comprehension: updating the same list
data = [x+3 for x in data]
print("Updating the list: ", data)
# Updating the list:  [5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 22, 26, 32, 34]

# Ex2: List comprehension: creating a different list with updated values
new_data = [x*2 for x in data]
print("Creating new list: ", new_data)
# Creating new list:  [10, 12, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 52, 64, 68]

# Ex3: With an if-condition: Multiples of four:
fourx = [x for x in new_data if x%4 == 0 ]
print("Divisible by four", fourx)
# Divisible by four [12, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 52, 64, 68]

# Ex4: Alternatively, we can update the list with the if condition as well
fourxsub = [x-1 for x in new_data if x%4 == 0 ]
print("Divisible by four minus one: ", fourxsub)
# Divisible by four minus one:  [11, 15, 19, 27, 31, 39, 43, 51, 63, 67]

# Ex5: Using range function:
nines = [x for x in range(100) if x%9 == 0]
print("Nines: ", nines)
# Nines:  [0, 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99]


# The given example provides different ways in which the list comprehensions can be used to update the list or generate a new list. 
# Comprehensions provide a short-hand and elegant way of updating sequences. As may be evident, the same code can be written using the conventional for loop 
# and if else conditions.

# List comprehension:
data = [x+3 for x in data]

# Regular for loop:
for x in range(len(data)):
    data[x] = data[x] + 3

# List comprehension can be a better option once you get the hang of it. 
# It must be noted how the same concept can be extended to include multiple if else conditions as necessary.

# List comprehensions are the most commonly used, but there are other types that can also make code pragmatic and simple. 
# The structure and syntax for them are very similar to that of list comprehensions except for the data types that are used. 

# 2. Dictionary comprehension
# syntax: dict = { key:value for key, value in <sequence> if <condition> } 

# Dictionary comprehension takes one or two lists as input and creates a dictionary out of it. 
# I will now demonstrate how this can be done using only one list and by using two lists. 

# Using range() function and no input list
usingrange = {x:x*2 for x in range(12)}
print("Using range(): ",usingrange)
# Using range():  {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 8, 5: 10, 6: 12, 7: 14, 8: 16, 9: 18, 10: 20, 11: 22}

# Lists
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "June", "July", "Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
number = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

# Using one input list
numdict = {x:x**2 for x in number}
print("Using one input list to create dict: ", numdict)
# Using one input list to create dict:  {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144}

# Using two input lists
months_dict = {key:value for (key, value) in zip(number, months)}
# Using two lists:  {1: 'Jan', 2: 'Feb', 3: 'Mar', 4: 'Apr', 5: 'May', 6: 'June', 7: 'July', 8: 'Aug', 9: 'Sept', 10: 'Oct', 11: 'Nov', 12: 'Dec'}

# Note how in case of using two lists, the format it follows is: 
# new_dict ={key:value for (key, value) in zip(list1, list2)}
# Here I used the zip function that combines the two lists. 
# When the two lists are of unequal length, the length of the shorter list is the length of the dictionary.

# 3. Set comprehension

# The set comprehension deals with the set data type and it's very similar to list comprehension. 
# The only key difference is the use of curly brackets for sets instead of square brackets as in lists. For example:

set_a = {x for x in range(10,20) if x not in [12,14,16]}
print(set_a)
# {10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19}

# You can see the code format is similar to what I used in list comprehensions. 
# For the sake of showing versatility, I used the "not in" keywords to check the values in the list. 
# The output is the values in ranges 10 and 20 that are not present in that list.

# 4. Generator comprehension

# Generator comprehensions are also very similar to lists with the variation of using curved brackets instead of square brackets. 
# They are also more memory efficient as compared to list comprehensions. For example:

data = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31]
gen_obj = (x for x in data)
print(gen_obj)
# <generator object <genexpr> at 0x102a87d60> 

print(type(gen_obj))
# <class 'generator'> 

for items in gen_obj:
    print(items, end = " ")
# 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31

# In the code above, I created a generator object of the class generator instead of a list. 
# The elements in this iterator object cannot be directly accessed and need the help of a for loop and as such, 
# I iterate over these elements and print them.

# We will shortly be looking at the difference between map() function and list comprehensions. 
# Assuming we know there is some function called square() that exists as below:

def square(num):
    return num * 2

# Here is the difference between map() function and list comprehensions:
newdata = map(square, data)
newdata = [x + 3 for x in data] 

# Notice how both map() functions and list comprehension effectively do the same job of modifying iterator sequences such as the list in the example above.
# List comprehensions have been a relatively recent development but it does not necessarily mean they are more efficient. 
# Comprehensions have gained popularity primarily for providing cleaner code readability and ease of use. 
# They also provide some added advantages such as providing filtering using if else conditions.

# List comprehensions also provide direct return of a list as compared to map() function that returns a map object. 
# It is mainly the clarity that has made list comprehensions popular,
# but map() functions are still arguably a better choice when it comes to the use of larger sequences.
