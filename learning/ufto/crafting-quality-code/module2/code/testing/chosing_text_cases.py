# To test count_lowercase_vowels, we need to:
# pick values for the string argument, and call the function to ensure it returns what we expect for each case.
# It is not realistic to test using every single possible string argument. Instead, we create relevant categories, 
# and choose one representative string argument from each category. To choose the string argument, consider:
# the length of the string, and the characters that make up the string.
# There are many possible string lengths. For this example, we'll consider strings that have these lengths:

# 0 (empty)
# 1 (single character)
# 6 (longer)

# Which characters should we use? For this example, we'll choose characters based on whether they are vowels or non-vowels. The actual character doesn't matter.
# If we want a non-vowel, we could use 'b', 'n', '?', or any other character that is not a vowel.

# We will make a table of the test cases with the following 3 columns:
# value of the argument to the function 
# expected return value of the function 
# a description of the test case

# s	        Expected Value	Description
# ''	        0	        empty string
# 'a'	        1	        single char, vowel
# 'b'	        0	        single char, non-vowel
# 'pfffft'	    0	        several chars, no vowels
# 'bandit'	    2	        several chars, some vowels
# 'aeioua'	    6	        several chars, all vowels*

# we included all 5 vowels to ensure each one is properly counted.

# Choosing tests for is_palindrome
def is_palindrome(s):
    """ (str) -> bool

    Return True if and only if s is a palindrome.

    >>> is_palindrome('noon')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('racecar')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('dented')
    False
    """

# Because the function returns a Boolean value, we need at least 2 test cases: one that returns True and one that returns False. 
# In this case, we actually need quite a few more than 2 test cases.
# As for the previous example, we need to choose different values for the string argument that represent different categories of strings.

# Dichotomy
# When we developed the code for is_palindrome(), we found that whether a string was even or odd affected the code. 
# Therefore, the tests should consider strings that have even and odd lengths. For this example, we'll consider strings that have these lengths:

# 0 and 1 (which are both considered palindromes)
# 2 (smallest possible non-empty even length palindrome, smallest possible non-palindrome)
# 3 (smallest possible multiple-character odd length palindrome)
# 6 (longer, even length string)
# 7 (longer, odd length string)

# The test cases are summarized in this table:

# s	    Expected Value	    Description
# ''	    True	            empty string
# 'a'	    True	            single character
# 'aa'	    True	            2 chars, palindrome
# 'ab'	    False	            2 chars, not palindrome
# 'aba'	    True	            3 chars, palindrome
# 'abc'	    False	            3 chars, not palindrome
# 'redder'	True	            longer, even, palindrome
# 'renter'	False	            longer, even, not palindrome
# 'racecar'	True	            longer, odd, palindrome
# 'banana'	False	            longer, odd, not palindrome

# General Tips When choosing test cases, consider the following factors:

# 1) Size
# For collections (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries) test with:
# empty collection
# a collection with 1 item
# smallest interesting case
# collection with several items

# 2) Dichotomies
# Consider your situation:
# For example:
# vowels/non-vowels
# even/odd
# positive/negative
# empty/full
# etc.

# 3) Boundaries
# If a function behaves differently for a value near a particular threshold (i.e. an if statement checking when a value is 3; 3 is a threshold), 
# test at that threshold.

# 4) Order
# If a function behaves differently when the values are in a different order, identify and test each of those orders.
# There is often overlap between the categories, so one test case may fall into more than 1 category.
